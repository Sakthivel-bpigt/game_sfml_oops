# ...Making a Game 

## Overview

I came across a situation where I had to explain how to work with C++ project to group of first timers. After that I decided to put that in writing, as a result I am writing here about how to make a simple 2D game.



## Game Idea 

Lets make a game called brick shooter, I got the idea from an old game I used to play which is called [bubble shooter](https://www.shooter-bubble.com/).

For programming part, I used C++ and started with C++98/03 version. This way we can see whats the difference between versions when we move to later versions. I used the microsoft visual studio 2012 IDE for this game development.

Obviously, The user interface(UI) for the game, or any application for that matter, with C++ is a whole lot of work. So I used the "Simple and Fast Multimedia Library" or simply SFML for UI support.

I have collected the 2D assets for the game from http://www.kenney.nl/

The above image shows some of the 2D assets. we can make different kinds of games using these assets, for example swipe game, pong game or shooter game.



I am planing to make a shooter game using those assets so they might look lot like this.

## Using This Project with Visual Studion 2017
* I used the Visual Studio 2012 when i made this project.
* If you want to use this project on Visual Studio 2017 you have to use the appropriate [SFML version](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) as well, in this case you can download SFML 2.5.* .
* In this project, find and replace the files from 'Includes' and 'Libs' folders with latest SFML version files and also the SFML DLLs in the debug folder.

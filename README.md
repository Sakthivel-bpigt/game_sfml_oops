#...Making a Game 
Overview
I came across situation where I had to explain how to work with C++ project to group of first timers. So I decided to put that in writing, as a result I am wrting this blog about how to make a simple 2D game.



Game Idea 
Lets make a brick shooter game, the idea is from the old famous game called bubble shooter.







For programming part, I am going with C++ and start with C++98/03 version, since the later versions are still growing. This way we can see whats the difference when we move to later versions. I will be using the microsoft visual studio 2012 IDE for this game development.





Obviously, making the user interface(UI) for the game, or any application for that matter, with C++ is a whole lot of work so I am going to use Simple and Fast Multimedia Library or simply SFML for UI support.





I have collected the 2D assets for the game from http://www.kenney.nl/





The above image shows some of the assets. we can make different kinds of games using these assets, for example swipe game, pong game or shooter game.



I am planing to make a shooter game using those assets so they might look lot like this.
